# Message Manager

Message Manager is a discord bot designed to make the management of important messages in servers easier, allowing the editing of a single message by more than one staff member.

Head on over to the [website](https://message.anothercat.me) for documentation, and in invite. 

## Techincal overview

Self hosting the bot is **unsupported**, but not forbidden, so if that's what you want to do proceed with caution. 

### Services

The bot runs via a set of different processes (shown below), this is done in order to improve efficency (as typical discord in-memory cache bots are resource intensive).

These processes have their own repo's under the organisation.
